## Original Todo
## Phase 3: Text Humanizer Tool with BAML (Full-Stack)

* **Goal:** Build the first AI-powered tool using BAML for reliable text humanization
* **Action:**
    1. **BAML Schema Definition:**
        - Create `/baml/baml_src/humanizer.baml` with:
            - `HumanizeRequest` type with text input and options
            - `HumanizeResponse` type with humanized text and confidence score
            - `humanize_text` function with structured prompts
        - Add retry logic and validation rules
        - Define multiple humanization styles (casual, professional, academic)
    2. **Backend API Endpoint:**
        - Create `/api/routes/humanizer.ts` with POST `/api/humanize`
        - Implement request validation using Zod schemas
        - Use BAML client for AI interactions
        - Add response caching for identical requests
        - Implement rate limiting per user/IP
    3. **Frontend Component:**
        - Create `/src/pages/tools/TextHumanizer.tsx`
        - Build UI with:
            - Large `Textarea` for input text
            - Style selector dropdown
            - "Humanize" button with loading state
            - Results display with copy functionality
        - Add character count and estimated tokens
        - Implement real-time preview if streaming is available
    4. **Error Handling:**
        - Graceful degradation for API failures
        - User-friendly error messages
        - Retry mechanism with exponential backoff

## Description
Building the first production-ready AI tool on our platform: a Text Humanizer that transforms AI-generated or robotic text into natural, human-like content. This full-stack implementation leverages our existing BAML foundation and API architecture to create a polished user experience with multiple humanization styles, real-time processing, and robust error handling. The tool serves as the flagship example of our AI development platform.
