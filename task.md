# Phase 0: BAML Foundation Setup
**Status:** InProgress

## Original Todo
## Phase 0: BAML Foundation Setup

* **Goal:** Establish BAML (Boundary AI Markup Language) as the foundation for all AI/LLM interactions
* **Action:**
    1. **Install BAML Dependencies:**
        - Add `@boundaryml/baml` for runtime functionality
        - Add `@boundaryml/baml-cli` as dev dependency for code generation
        - Update package.json scripts with BAML commands (`baml generate`, `baml validate`)
    2. **Create BAML Project Structure:**
        - Create `/baml` directory for all BAML definitions
        - Create `/baml/baml_src` for source files
        - Set up `/baml_client` directory for generated TypeScript clients
        - Create `baml.yaml` configuration file with provider settings
    3. **Configure Environment:**
        - Set up `.env` file structure for API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
        - Configure BAML providers and model selection
        - Set up environment-specific configurations (dev, staging, prod)
    4. **Define Base Templates:**
        - Create shared type definitions in `/baml/baml_src/shared/types.baml`
        - Define common error handling patterns
        - Build reusable prompt components

## Description
We're establishing BAML (Boundary AI Markup Language) as the foundational layer for all AI/LLM interactions in the project. This includes setting up the project structure, installing dependencies, configuring AI providers (OpenAI and Anthropic), creating type-safe schemas, and establishing patterns for building production-ready AI-powered tools. The foundation will enable reliable, type-safe, and testable AI features starting with the Text Humanizer tool.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Install BAML dependencies (@boundaryml/baml runtime) ✅ DONE
- [x] Create BAML project structure (baml_src/ directory) ✅ DONE  
- [x] Configure generator settings ✅ DONE
- [x] Create .env.example template ✅ DONE
- [x] Update .gitignore ✅ DONE
- [x] Add BAML scripts to package.json ✅ DONE
- [x] Create shared BAML types ✅ DONE
- [x] Configure AI providers ✅ DONE
- [x] Create base prompt templates ✅ DONE
- [x] Set up TypeScript client wrapper ✅ DONE
- [x] Generate BAML client ✅ DONE
- [ ] Test BAML client generation works correctly
- [ ] Test BAML validation passes
- [ ] Automated test: Verify npm run baml:generate succeeds without errors
- [ ] User test: Confirm TypeScript client is properly generated and importable

## Notes
Most of the BAML foundation setup was already completed. The remaining work is to verify everything functions correctly and is ready for building AI-powered tools.
