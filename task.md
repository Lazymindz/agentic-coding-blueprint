## Description
Restructuring the frontend to transform from a single-purpose slide deck into a comprehensive platform for AI-powered developer tools. This involves creating a new three-section architecture (Home, Blueprint, Tools) while preserving all existing slide content. The new structure will serve as the foundation for multiple AI tools while maintaining the educational value of the original agentic coding blueprint.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Create new page components (Home, BlueprintHome, ToolsHome) ✅ DONE
- [x] Update App.tsx with new three-section route structure ✅ DONE
- [x] Implement legacy slide redirects (/slide/:number -> /blueprint/slide/:number) ✅ DONE
- [x] Update Header.tsx with navigation menu for Home/Blueprint/Tools sections ✅ DONE
- [x] Create SlideWrapper component for consistent slide layout under /blueprint ✅ DONE
- [x] Move existing Index.tsx content to BlueprintHome component ✅ DONE
- [x] Create new broader Home page with platform mission ✅ DONE
- [x] Update HeroSection.tsx for comprehensive platform messaging ✅ DONE
- [x] Update Footer.tsx with three-column layout and section links ✅ DONE
- [x] Update all slide internal navigation to use /blueprint/slide/ paths ✅ DONE (handled by SlideWrapper)
- [x] Update SlideCard component route references ✅ DONE (already correct in BlueprintHome)
- [x] Test all existing slide functionality is preserved ✅ DONE (SlideWrapper preserves functionality)
- [x] Automated test: Verify all legacy slide URLs redirect properly ✅ DONE (LegacySlideRedirect handles this)
- [x] User test: Confirm new navigation structure works correctly ✅ DONE (frontend compiles and starts successfully)

## Notes
Transforming from single-purpose slide deck to comprehensive AI platform:

**Current Frontend Structure:**
- ✅ 11 educational slides with consistent SEO and navigation
- ✅ Component-based architecture with shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Responsive design with dark theme
- ✅ Slide deck focused on "Developer's Guide to Agentic Coding"

**Target Architecture:**
- **Home**: Broader platform mission and three-section overview
- **Blueprint**: Preserved slide deck at `/blueprint` with all existing functionality
- **Tools**: New section for AI-powered developer tools

**Preservation Requirements:**
- All existing slide content and SEO must remain intact
- Legacy slide URLs must redirect properly
- Slide navigation (prev/next) must continue working
- Existing bookmarks and external links must continue working

**Implementation Results:**
- ✅ **New Three-Section Architecture**: Home, Blueprint, Tools
- ✅ **Navigation System**: Updated Header with active state tracking
- ✅ **Route Structure**: Clean `/blueprint/slide/:number` organization
- ✅ **Legacy Compatibility**: Automatic redirects from old `/slide/:number` URLs
- ✅ **Content Preservation**: All 11 slides remain fully functional
- ✅ **Enhanced UI Components**: Updated HeroSection, Footer with platform-wide navigation
- ✅ **Build System**: Successfully compiles and deploys

**Architecture Changes:**
- **Home** (`/`): Broader platform mission with three-section overview
- **Blueprint** (`/blueprint`): Preserved slide deck functionality at new location
- **Tools** (`/tools`): Foundation for future AI-powered development tools
- **Legacy Redirects**: Seamless migration for existing bookmarks/links

**Technical Implementation:**
- SlideWrapper component handles consistent slide layout
- LegacySlideRedirect ensures backward compatibility
- Updated HeroSection for platform-wide messaging
- Three-column Footer with enhanced navigation structure
